  ### Description

  This is a project where we auto generate a logo based on 4 inputs: a maximum 3 character input, a color for the name, a shape from a list, and the color for the shape. This will then generate an SVG file that continues a 300 by 200 image of the desired logo. If the input is longer than 3 characters, the file will not be made. If the color is spelled incorrectly or doesn't exist, it will default to black.

  ## Installation
  To install run the following commands:
  ```
  npm install inquirer@6.5.0
  
  npm install jest@28.0.0
  ```

  ## Usage
  For the generation of an SVG file. I downloaded the extension SVG-Viewer in VSCode to view the SVG image in VSCode instead of having to open it in a browser and worry about the format. 

  The video of usage is [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kLdJqWobZ9APpfKIDyS62pF1W97wg7Eu/view?usp=share_link).
